# System Architecture

The AI-Adaptive-Aero-F1 system is composed of the following core components:

- **Sensor Interface**: Collects real-time data from the car and environment.
- **AI Engine**: Uses machine learning models to make aerodynamic decisions.
- **Actuation System**: Adjusts aerodynamic components (wings, flaps) in real-time.

The system ensures optimal balance between downforce and drag by adapting dynamically during a race.
