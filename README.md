# 🚗 AI-Adaptive-Aero-F1

An AI-powered system that dynamically adjusts a Formula 1 car’s aerodynamic components in real time to enhance performance, reduce drag, and increase fuel and tire efficiency.

## 📌 What the Project Is

**AI-Adaptive-Aero-F1** is a research and development project that focuses on improving Formula 1 car dynamics using Artificial Intelligence. The system leverages real-time sensor data and intelligent control algorithms to modify components like front/rear wings and body panels — adapting on the fly to race conditions.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Sensors** mounted on the car collect real-time data:
   - Track surface conditions
   - Car speed, angle, and position
   - Proximity to other competitors

2. The data is fed into an **AI engine** that:
   - Analyzes changing conditions instantly
   - Makes decisions to adjust aerodynamic parts
   - Balances drag and downforce based on needs (e.g., cornering, overtaking)

3. The system sends control signals to actuators that **physically adjust the aerodynamic elements** in real time.
